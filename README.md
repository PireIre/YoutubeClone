## Motivation
This project was build during SDA Course. It is a first project when we were using React during the course.
Purpose was to learn basics of: 
- React Component
- React Props (Parent/Child)
- Asset Loading (Fetching JSON file data)
- Rendering multiple components (using .map function)
- Routing (creating different pages)
